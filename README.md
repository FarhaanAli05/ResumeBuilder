# ICS4U Final Project ‚Äì Resume Builder

This is a Java-based Resume Builder application created for the ICS4U final project. It allows users to input and manage their resume data such as education, work experience, custom sections, and summary details.

### How It Works

- Users are prompted to enter their basic contact details (name, phone number, location, email).
- The program works with the user step by step as they enter prompts to complete various categories of the resume.
- The resume is saved as a `.txt` file named after the name given (e.g. `John Doe - Resume.txt`).
- Various categories include:
  - **Summary**
  - **Education**
  - **Skills**
  - **Highlights**
  - **Experience**
  - **Other Interests**
  - **Competitions**
  - **Custom** sections (user-defined)
